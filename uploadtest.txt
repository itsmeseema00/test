 Hi Ankush, I was trying to upload documents to same vendor(lpq) that we are using for personal loan. But since that loan number 12345 isnot there in LPQ it is throwing me ResponseError: INTERNAL_ERROR - Invalid app specified.  Do we need to use same vendor or we will be using other vendor for business? please advise

You don't need to update to LPQ

LPQ is used by Consumer Lending only for which we have the Loan Status page
Mortage and Business department don't use LPQ
We do not need to send the notification email also for Mortgage and Business. We may need to but it will be decided later

 
 
how cna you view business loans for this person
account status pag shows loans othe rthan business
and what tables to look for bisuness loans
info on them  
how cna u retrieve it

do u have to use org no or persnbr or tax id
how cna u get the value
chekc a loan number and see all its details
get table info

you would liek to see info of thet particular loan number
which table to llok
as u need to load it from nbo

i am getting secure msg from message table. i want  to see info of that particular loan number
which table to look?



business loan is created by another team by manually entering this info .. only after loan is created we get loan Number
from our end we only pass this info

lendingRepositoryPrefix will be pre-defined
assume it to be just the businessloan
businessloan\loan

We don't know if they Business department will want have upload for separate products
So, for now just the businessloan
as your SM link is what u comtrol
on click u would know its cming from secure message based on parameters
at that pint create a dummy loan type as business
and at check add new if checking for business loan and set repo path

at that point set a dummy loan type as business
and in utility where u checking loan type add ur check for business and set the repo path from config file
hi Ankush, how can we distinguish what type of loan is coming(personal or business). IS there any way we could add extra query params in links to link what kind of loan are coming so we could write logic according to that in DocumentUploadManager

Then, run this test file in eclipse by changing the repository to what you used: TestGetDocumentService.java
You need to change the JRE eclipse is using to the one being used by Websphere
Certificate is already added to the JRE being used by WebSphere
So, either 'you can use the same JRE by right clicking in eclipse and selecting either Run or Debug configurations' or 'you can install the certificate to the JRE being used by eclipse;
