#--FAQ 
edeposit.title.text = eDeposits Frequently Asked Questions
edeposit.faq.question1 = What is eDeposits? 
edeposit.faq.answer1 = A secure service that allows you to scan or photograph paper checks and electronically send the images to RBFCU for deposit.
edeposit.faq.question2 = Who is eligible to scan deposits? How do I know if I am eligible? 
edeposit.faq.answer2 = Members who meet the product requirements will have "Make eDeposit" in the "I want to" drop down menu on the Account Summary Page.  Members can also see if they qualify by going to their My Profile link in the top right hand corner of the page.  There members will select the "Member Services" link.  Under the eDeposits section, members will see whether or not they are eligible to make deposits online.  The basic requirements include having the account open for a minimum of 60 days and not having any derogatory information on the account (i.e. delinquent payments).

edeposit.faq.answer4.list5 = High Speed Internet Connection;
edeposit.faq.answer4.list6 = TWAIN Compliant Scanner.
edeposit.faq.question5 =Can I use any home scanner? 
edeposit.faq.answer5 =eDeposits uses the TWAIN specification for communicating with scanners. Most scanner software supports the TWAIN specification, but not all. For the latest information for specific scanners, enter eDeposits and click &quot;Help with Scanners and Drivers&quot; near the bottom of the New Deposit screen or consult with your scanner manufacturer for information on their support for TWAIN on your device.  
edeposit.faq.question6 = How do I access eDeposits?
edeposit.faq.answer6 = When you log into NetBranch Online, you will see the "I want to" dropdown column on the right hand side of your Account Summary page as seen below.  Each of your accounts has its own "I want to" dropdown menu.  Within the "I want to" dropdown menu on savings and checking accounts, you will see "Make eDeposit". 
edeposit.faq.answer6.steps.instruct = You can start scanning your checks in 4 easy steps:
edeposit.faq.answer6.step1 = Endorse the back of your check with your signature, the words &quot;For Deposit Only at RBFCU&quot;, your RBFCU Account Number where the funds will be deposited, the words &quot;via eDeposits&quot; and the date of the deposit.
edeposit.faq.answer6.step2 = Log onto NetBranch Online.
edeposit.faq.answer6.step3 = On the Account Summary page, click the "I want to" dropdown arrow to select "Make eDeposit" for the Savings or Checking account to deposit the funds.  The "I want to" dropdown is also located on the top of the Account Activity page. 
edeposit.faq.answer6.step4 = Use the &quot;Choose Scanner&quot; button to choose the appropriate scanner if your computer does not pre-select it for you. Enter the total deposit amount. Then, using your own scanner, simply scan the front and back of the check and click the submit button to continue to the Deposit Review step. An email will be sent to you once your deposit has been submitted to the credit union for processing. Please store your check(s) in a safe place until you receive confirmation via the deposit history on NetBranch Online that your deposit has been accepted, and then destroy the check by shredding or another commercially acceptable means of data destruction.
edeposit.faq.question7 = I scanned deposits before but now I do not see the eDeposits option in the "I want to" dropdown menu?  
edeposit.faq.answer7 = RBFCU uses an automatic enrollment process based on pre-determined criteria. Every time you log into NetBranch Online, the system will determine product eligibility. A member&#39;s ability to use this service may be terminated without notice if they fail to meet the requirements or fail to comply with the requirements of the services. If you no longer meet the requirements, you will not be eligible to scan deposits, you will need to mail in your deposits or take them to a convenient branch location for deposit.
edeposit.faq.question8 = Can any type of check be scanned for deposit?
edeposit.faq.answer8 = No. You can only scan single-party domestic checks made payable to the owner(s) of the account. Savings Bonds, foreign checks, third party checks, checks written to you from another account of yours at RBFCU, items stamped with &quot;non-negotiable, incomplete checks, stale-dated or post-dated&quot; checks, any checks that contain evidence of alteration to the information, checks purported to be a lottery or prize winning and checks previously submitted for deposit are not acceptable for scanning. 
edeposit.faq.question9 = When will my deposit be credited to my account?
edeposit.faq.answer9 = Deposits scanned Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. until 7 p.m. and on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m., Central Time on days the credit union is open should be credited on the same business day. Deposits scanned after those times should be credited on the next business day. There could be times that the program may flag a deposit for manual review and release by credit union personnel (i.e. image is not clear when received at the credit union). If this happens, you will see the deposit under the Deposit History tab as &quot;Submitted Deposit&quot; and you will not see the deposit reflected on NetBranch Online until credit union personnel has an opportunity to review and release the deposit. The manual review process should happen the same business day, the next business day at the latest.
edeposit.faq.question10 = Do I need to include a deposit slip with my scanned check deposit?
edeposit.faq.answer10 = No. The eDeposits program generates an electronic record with each deposit.
edeposit.faq.question11 = How many checks can be included in one deposit? Can multiple deposits be submitted each day?
edeposit.faq.answer11 = Up to 999 checks can be included in one deposit and multiple deposits can be submitted as long as the accumulated dollar amount of the deposit(s) does not exceed the daily deposit limit.
edeposit.faq.question12 = How much is the deposit limit?
edeposit.faq.answer12 = The default daily dollar deposit limit is &#36;5,000 and the monthly cumulative dollar deposit limit is &#36;50,000.  
edeposit.faq.question13 = What fees are charged to use eDeposits services?
edeposit.faq.answer13 = Members can enjoy the convenience of eDeposits without incurring a fee from the credit union. 
edeposit.faq.question14 = Is the hold policy for checks different when they are scanned? 
edeposit.faq.answer14 = No. The hold policy is defined in the Funds Availability Policy in the Membership & Account Agreement, which can be found on our website under &quot;About Us&quot;.
edeposit.faq.question15 =What type of accounts can I scan deposits into? 
edeposit.faq.answer15 = eDeposits can be made to your savings or checking account.
edeposit.faq.question16 = What should I do with the check once it has been scanned? 
edeposit.faq.answer16 = Store your check(s) in a safe place until you receive confirmation via the deposit history on NetBranch Online that your deposit has been accepted, and then destroy the check by shredding or another commercially acceptable means of data destruction.
edeposit.faq.question17 = I scanned my check and clicked on continue and an hourglass is tumbling but nothing is happening. What&#39;s wrong?
edeposit.faq.answer17 = If the browser hangs with an hourglass, this is caused by security software on your network blocking the outbound HTTPS connection of the ActiveX control. The ActiveX software uses a direct HTTPS connection to upload your check images for processing, and will not use a configured proxy server. For most users, this does not cause any problems. However, some users may have a non-transparent proxy that prevents this direct connection, and the browser may hang with an hourglass. The Java version of eDeposits properly uses your browsers proxy configuration and will correct this error.
edeposit.faq.question18 = What if I encounter problems when the credit union is closed?
edeposit.faq.answer18.part1= eDeposits is designed as an easy-to-use, self-service product. Select &quot;Help&quot; or 
edeposit.faq.answer18.part2 = on each line of the process for a detailed explanation, helpful hints and a short video explanation of that process step.  
edeposit.faq.question19 = How do I get a copy of my deposit?
edeposit.faq.answer19 = If you click on the Deposit History Tab at the top right corner of the page, a listing of your scanned deposits will be displayed. If you click on the 
edeposit.faq.answer19a = icon, you can view the deposit details along with a copy of the items included in that deposit. If you click on the

edeposit.faq.question23= I am trying to scan the back of my check and continue to receive an Image Quality Error, Image Too Light. What can I do? 
edeposit.faq.answer23.part1 = Ensure you have properly endorsed the check. If not, delete the back image of the check you have scanned, endorse the item and rescan. If you have the proper endorsement on the check, it is possible your scanner is not detecting the whole check. You can try using the cropping feature below the scanned image within eDeposits, adjusting the brightness feature of your scanner, select &#39;custom&#39; image instead of &#39;color&#39; image if the option is available on your scanner or drawing dots on each corner of the check.

edeposit.faq.question24 = I have scanned the front and back of my check but it is giving me an error message that the size of the back and the front of the check do not match. How can I fix this?
edeposit.faq.answer24.part1 = Proper cropping of check images is essential to ensuring that deposited checks are processed successfully. Most scanners allow images to be cropped by previewing the scanned image then moving the box to properly surround the check. Try placing the check on the border of the scanning screen to line up the front and back of the check so the scanner reads the size of the check the same way. Clicking on the
edeposit.faq.answer24.part2 = below the scanned image screen will give you more detailed instructions for properly cropping a check.
edeposit.faq.question25 = Can I request my daily/monthly deposit limit be increased?
edeposit.faq.answer25 = Yes, you can contact NetBranch Services (Personal Accounts) or Business Services (Business Accounts) and we will do an account review to determine if an increase is needed.
